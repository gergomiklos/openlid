# NoSleepAgent

Keeps your Mac awake while your agents are working — close the lid and the job keeps running. Once they are idle, normal sleep comes back.

Works with **Claude Code** and **Codex**.

## How it works

Claude Code / Codex hooks stamp a "last activity" time on every prompt and tool
call. A root daemon checks it every 30s:

- active in the last 10 min → `pmset disablesleep 1` (stay awake, lid open or closed)
- idle → `pmset disablesleep 0` (sleep normally)

A timestamp drives everything — no state machine.

## Menu bar

An icon shows the live state so you can check before closing the lid:

- ⚡️ **Awake** — safe to close the lid, the job keeps running
- 🌙 **Will sleep** — closing the lid now sleeps the Mac

Click it to pause/resume keep-awake or quit.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gergomiklos/nosleepagent.git
cd nosleepagent
./install.sh
```

Wires up the hooks for both Claude Code (`~/.claude/settings.json`) and Codex
(`~/.codex/hooks.json`), backing up each first, installs the daemon, and adds a
`/nosleep` command. Needs `sudo` (flipping `disablesleep` is root-only). Works on
any Mac.

Afterward: restart open Claude Code sessions; in Codex, run `/hooks` and trust
the new hooks.

## Use

Nothing — it just runs. To turn it off: `./ctl.sh off` (`on` / `status`), or
`/nosleep off` inside Claude Code.

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes the daemon and re-enables normal sleep.
